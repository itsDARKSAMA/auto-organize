# auto-organize
Python script to organize your files automatically


## how it works 

1. Copy the **organize.py** file to the directory where you want to organize files.
2. run it by typing `python organize.py `  or `python3 organize.py` in your terminal or cmd .

#### Notes : 
1. you need to install the os and shutil modules if they are not already installed :blush:
2. you need to open your terminal or your cmd in the directory where you want to organize files
